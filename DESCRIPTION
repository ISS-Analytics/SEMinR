Description: SEMinR offers an natural syntax for R to create and estimate PLS structural equation models.
             It particularly seeks to bring the latest thinking and research to PLS estimation of SEM models.
             SEMinR is suited to methodologists seeking to push the boundaries of modeling and estimation using PLS,
             and for practitioners seeking to incorporate the latest thinking into their PLS path models. SEMinR is
             open sourced in the hope that its implementation can serve as a reference model to developers, researchers, 
             and practitioners.
