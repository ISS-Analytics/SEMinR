Description: A powerful, easy to syntax for specifying and estimating complex Structural Equation Models (SEM). Models can be estimated using: Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS-PM) or
    Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modeling (CBSEM) or covariance based Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). PLS models also supports Consistent PLS as per Dijkstra & Henseler (2015, MISQ 39(2): 297-316), adjusted interactions as per 
    Henseler & Chin (2010) <doi:10.1080/10705510903439003> and bootstrapping utilizing  parallel processing as per Hair et al. (2017, ISBN:978-1483377445). 
    CBSEM and CFA models use the Lavaan package for estimation.
