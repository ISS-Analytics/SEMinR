![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sem-in-r/seminr.svg?branch=master)

SEMinR brings many advancements to creating and estimating structural equation models (SEM) using Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS-PM):

* A _natural_ feeling, _domain-specific_ language to build and estimate structural equation models in R
* Uses _variance-based PLS estimation_ to model both _composite_ and _common-factor_ constructs
* _High-level functions_ to quickly specify interactions and complicated structural models

SEMinR follows the latest best-practices in methodological literature:

* Automatically _adjusts PLS estimates to ensure consistency (PLSc)_ wherever common factors are involved
* Ajusts for known biases in interaction terms in PLS models
* Continuously tested against leading PLSPM software to ensure parity of outcomes: SmartPLS (Ringle et al., 2015) and ADANCO (Henseler and Dijkstra, 2015), as well as other R packages such as semPLS (Monecke and Leisch, 2012) and matrixpls (Rönkkö, 2016)
* _High performance, multi-core_ bootstrapping function

## Documentation

The vignette for Seminr can be found in the [seminr/doc/](https://github.com/ISS-Analytics/seminr/blob/master/doc/SEMinR.html) folder or by running the `vignette("SEMinR")` command after installation.

Demo code for use of Seminr can be found in the [seminr/demo/](https://github.com/ISS-Analytics/seminr/tree/master/demo) folder or by running the `demo("seminr-contained")`, `demo("seminr-ecsi")` or `demo("seminr-interaction")` commands after installation.

## Installation

You can install SEMinR with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("seminr")
```

## Usage

Briefly, there are four steps to specifying and estimating a structural equation model using SEMinR:

1 Describe measurement model for each construct and its items including any interactions or higher order constructs:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Distinguish and mix composite or reflective (common-factor) measurement models
measurements <- constructs(
  composite("Image",       multi_items("IMAG", 1:5), weights = mode_B),
  composite("Expectation", multi_items("CUEX", 1:3), weights = mode_A),
  reflective("Loyalty",    multi_items("CUSL", 1:3)),
  composite("Quality",      multi_items("PERQ", 1:7)),
  composite("Complaints",   single_item("CUSCO")),
  interaction_term("Image*Expectation", dimensions = c("Image","Expectation"), method = orthogonal),
  interaction_term("Image*Value", dimensions = c("Image","Value"), method = orthogonal),
  higher_composite("Value", dimensions = c("Quality","Complaints"), method = two_stage, weights = mode_B)
)
```


2 Describe the structural model of causal relationships between constructs (and interactions):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Quickly create multiple paths "from" and "to" sets of constructs
structure <- relationships(
  paths(from = c("Image", "Expectation", "Image*Expectation","Image*Value"), 
        to = "Loyalty")
)
```

3 Put the above elements together to estimate and bootstrap the model:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Dynamically compose SEM models from individual parts
pls_model <- estimate_pls(data = mobi, measurements, structure)
summary(pls_model)

# Use multi-core parallel processing to speed up bootstraps
boot_estimates <- bootstrap_model(pls_model, nboot = 1000, cores = 2)
summary(boot_estimates)
```
